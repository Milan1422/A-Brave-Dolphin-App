Our application was built on the basis that there is a need for youths in this country to have a great mentor to teach them a trade and/or career be that a trade in cooking, auto mechanic, web development, or any number of trades out there. Young people need to have an adult show them how to become an adult. Our application can be used as the mentor signing up to mentor a youth and in this process we have the mentor provide mentor email, Linked in, Twitter, Instagram for security purposes with all this information provided we put them through a rigorous vetting process i.e. employment verification, work history, social media, etc to ensure the safety of our youths. The youth's parents can also sign up providing their email, youth name, and creating a username for them to continually log into the site. After they sign up they are assigned a mentor based on their interest and hobbies. This also meets parameters of a GET and POST route based on the requirements above. We have also included a chat function where the youth can see who is currently online and reach out to the mentor outside of regularly scheduled meetings to ask questions about something they need help with or just for some advice. The chat function was successfully completed by our new technology socket.io which is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server. This application is meant to reach all youths and mentors by being completely mobile friendly in sign up, login, and regular use. Our future development plans for this application will be to have a feature that will expand the chat box to a live face chat session so the youth can get hands on advice on current projects. Also we would like to utilize an npm package called cloudinary which would allow the mentor and/or youth to post a current picture while they are signing up to their profile. 

# Lessons:

We have learned a lot on this project about the full stack application since this project differs so much from the first project it allowed all of os time to experience frontend, backend, and even some middleware development just based on the requirements for the project. The middle ware protects the security of our users by utilizing bcrypt which is an npm library that encrypts the password that a user inputs.
